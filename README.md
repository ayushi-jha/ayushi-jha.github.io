Static Website with just HTML, CSS and JS.

Animation of logo inspired from [Anthony Fu](https://antfu.me/), this is a good read - [animated-svg-logo.md](https://github.com/antfu/antfu.me/blob/main/pages/posts/animated-svg-logo.md). Referenced here is [another beautifully written article by Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/), with a thoroughly clear explanation of svg properties and animation that makes this possible. Other good reads around the same (after I went down the rabbit hole of references):
